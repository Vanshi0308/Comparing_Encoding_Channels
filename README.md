# Comparing Encoding Channels

#### By Vanshika Sinha

In this project, a comparison is carried out among different encoding channels in visualization for the gapminder.csv file.

## Part-1

For this part, 3 charts have been constructed. The year has been encoded by x-position and life expectancy has been encoded by y-position by encoding continent by shape, by colour and by brightness for the 3 charts.

## Part-2

For this part, 3 charts have been constructed. The GDP has been encoded by x-position and life expectancy has been encoded by y-position by encoding population by size, by brightness and by colour for the 3 charts.

## Part-3

For this part, 1 interactive chart has been constructed. The GDP per capita has been encoded by x-position, life expectancy has been encoded by y-position and year has been encoded by z-position by encoding population by size, encoding country by colour and encoding continent by shape.

## Tools used

The charts have been plotted using python programming. The python libraries used for constructing charts are plotly for plotting the graph and pandas for ingesting data into the program.
